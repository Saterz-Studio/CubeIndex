# CubeIndex

**CubeIndex** is a personal project and cubing knowledge hub — a growing database that catalogs everything related to speedcubing: puzzles, algorithms, records, brands, solving methods, and more.

Built with **SvelteKit** and **TailwindCSS**, CubeIndex focuses on clean design, fast performance, and useful information. It also features a built-in cube timer — a practical bonus for practicing what you learn.

## Why I'm Building This

I'm Ilan (aka [Saterz](https://saterz.dev)), a 15-year-old self-taught dev and cubing nerd. I built CubeIndex to merge two passions: **coding** and **cubing**. It’s both a personal learning journey and a tool I wish existed when I started speedcubing.

## Roadmap

- [ ] MVP release with timer, puzzles, and algs
- [ ] Add filtering, search, and personal notes
- [ ] Optimize mobile UX
- [ ] Consider community contributions
